### Multimedia content copyright protection system for national digital library
#### Software information
Operation interface:  
<img src="https://xszhugh.github.io/images/national-digital-library.png" width="60%"  />   
<font color='blue'>Figures 1 Operation interface for multimedia content copyright protection system   </font>
Software size: 3788KB  
Platform: Windows  
Developing language: c and c++  
#### Functions  
The core algorithm of digital watermarking is made into a dynamic link library for the use of the main program. The system can embed and detect watermark information in images, audio and video. It supports many file formats, such as bmp, jpg, tif, avi, MPEG1, MPEG2 and wav. The system manages multimedia content from three levels: 1) copyright protection is achieved by embedding visual watermarking and invisible watermarking into the identity of copyright owner; 2) by embedding fragile watermarking to prevent content from being illegally tampered with; 3) by traditional encryption technology to prevent key information from being illegally acquired. 

### Mobile watermarking system  
#### Software information  
Operation interface:

<font color='blue'>Figures 2 Operation interface for Mobile watermarking system   </font>
Software size: 87KB  
Platform: Win CE  
Developing language: c and c++  
####  Functions  
When embedding watermark, the complete path of the target image , watermark information and key are filled in the operation interface, and the watermark information is embedded into the target image by the watermark embedding module. When detecting watermark, the complete path of the target image and watermark key are input into the operation interface, and the watermark information is extracted and displayed by the watermark detection module. The system can be directly run on the terminal equipment to protect the copyright of digital images, and can be applied to secure communications, digital fingerprints, copy control and broadcast monitoring.

### Robust watermarking technology for cultural relics and art pictures

<font color='blue'>Figures 3 Operation interface for cultural image watermarking   </font>
Platform: Windows  
Developing language: c and c++  
#### functions
It mainly solves the problem of watermark embedding and detection in large-scale cultural relic images (see Fig. 10). The core algorithm of digital watermarking is made into a dynamic link library for the host program to call. The algorithm has three typical features: 1) watermark is embedded in the transform domain of the signal, but the whole watermark embedding process only needs to carry out one inverse transform to the carrier signal, which greatly reduces the complexity of the watermark; 2) watermark embedding strength is adaptively adjusted in image space domain, which is especially for images with damaged or irregular shape cultural relics, such as unearthed ancient costumes, murals, and pictures of ancient inscriptions; 3) The use of image moments based on fast image normalization technology to enhance the robustness of watermarking against geometric attacks. The scheme has been successfully applied to the copyright protection system of cultural relics and literary pictures in the National Library.

### Robust multi-bit video watermarking for national TV drama filing and management system  
#### Software information

<font color='blue'>Figures 5 Operation interface for robust multi-bit video watermarking   </font>
Platform: Windows  
Developing language: c and c++  
#### functions
To test the copyright or source of TV drama, the scheme combines Trellis code, three-dimensional wavelet transform, affine modular transformation based scrambling algorithm, and quantization modulation based on random normalized correlation coefficients. The main feature of the scheme is to set the relevant parameters of watermark embedding rate and robustness on the basis of rigorous theoretical analysis and Monte Carlo simulation experiment. Watermarking detection is blind detection, and does not need the watermark embedding strength information. It can hide multi-bit watermark information in the video signal and satisfy the human eye imperceptibility. It has good robustness to video coding, transcoding, Gamma correction, noise, filtering and other operations.
